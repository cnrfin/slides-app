# Fixed: Text Dimensions and Zoom Behavior

## The Problem
When zooming in/out after editing text, the text element's dimensions were changing, causing misalignment between the text content and its selection borders.

## The Root Cause
Text elements were rendering at their natural width (no constraints) while selection borders used stored dimensions. This mismatch became apparent when zooming.

## The Solution
Text elements now render with their stored width and height constraints, ensuring consistent dimensions regardless of zoom level.

### Changes Made in ElementRenderer.tsx:

```javascript
// Before: Text rendered without width constraints
const { width, height, ...textProps } = props
<Text {...textProps} wrap="none" />

// After: Text renders with stored dimensions
<Text 
  {...props} 
  width={element.width}
  height={element.height}
  wrap="none"
/>
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Text Creation**: Measures natural dimensions and stores them
2. **Text Display**: Always renders at stored width/height
3. **Text Editing**: Updates stored dimensions when saved
4. **Zoom Behavior**: Text maintains consistent size relative to canvas

## Benefits

- ✅ No dimension changes when zooming
- ✅ Selection borders always match text bounds
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all zoom levels
- ✅ Text stays within its defined boundaries

## Note on Edit Mode
The zoom/pan disable during edit mode is still active to prevent other issues, but the main dimension problem is now fixed at the rendering level.
