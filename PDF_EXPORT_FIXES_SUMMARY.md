# PDF Export Rendering Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Blurb Element Tail Rendering
**Problem**: The triangular tail of speech bubble (blurb) elements was not rendering in the PDF export.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper tail drawing logic in the PDF export for all tail positions (bottom-left, bottom-center, bottom-right, top-left, top-center, top-right, left-center, right-center)
- The tail is now drawn as a separate triangular path after the main bubble body
- Both fill and stroke are applied to maintain consistency with canvas rendering

### 2. Image Corner Radius
**Problem**: Images with corner radius were not displaying rounded corners in the PDF export.

**Solution**:
- Created a clipping path with rounded corners before drawing the image
- The clipping path respects the borderRadius percentage value
- When borderRadius is 100%, creates a perfect circular/elliptical clipping path
- Works with all image objectFit modes (cover, contain, fill, etc.)

### 3. Shape Corner Radius for Perfect Circles
**Problem**: Shapes with 100% border radius were not rendering as perfect circles/ellipses in the PDF.

**Solution**:
- Added special handling for 100% border radius to use `ctx.ellipse()` for perfect circles/ellipses
- For partial radius values (0-99%), uses quadratic curves for rounded corners
- Ensures the radius doesn't exceed half of the smallest dimension
- Works with both filled shapes and shapes with borders

## Files Modified

1. **`src/utils/pdf-export.ts`**
   - Updated blurb rendering case to draw tails
   - Added clipping path for images with corner radius
   - Fixed shape rendering for perfect circles with 100% radius

## Test Files Created

1. **`src/test/test-pdf-render-fixes.ts`**
   - Comprehensive test suite for all three fixes
   - Creates 4 test slides with various configurations
   - Tests all blurb tail positions
   - Tests image corner radius from 0% to 100%
   - Tests shape corner radius, especially 100% for circles
   - Combined test with all fixes working together

## How to Test

### Method 1: Using the Test File

```typescript
// In a component or test runner
import { testPDFRenderFixes } from '@/test/test-pdf-render-fixes'

// Call the test function
testPDFRenderFixes().then(() => {
  console.log('Test completed!')
})
```

This will generate `test-render-fixes.pdf` with 4 slides demonstrating all fixes.

### Method 2: Manual Testing in the App

1. **Test Blurb Tails**:
   - Create a blurb element
   - Change the tail position in the element properties
   - Export to PDF and verify the tail appears correctly

2. **Test Image Corner Radius**:
   - Add an image element
   - Set the border radius to various values (0%, 25%, 50%, 100%)
   - For 100% radius on a square image, it should appear as a perfect circle
   - Export to PDF and verify rounded corners

3. **Test Shape Corner Radius**:
   - Create a rectangle shape
   - Set border radius to 100%
   - The shape should appear as a perfect circle (if square) or ellipse (if rectangular)
   - Export to PDF and verify the shape

## Expected Results

### Slide 1: Blurb Elements
- 6 blurb elements showing all tail positions
- Each blurb should have a visible triangular tail pointing in the correct direction
- Text inside blurbs should be properly aligned

### Slide 2: Images with Corner Radius
- 5 images with different corner radius values
- The 100% radius image should appear as a perfect circle
- Rectangular image with 100% radius should appear as an ellipse

### Slide 3: Shapes with Corner Radius  
- 7 shapes demonstrating corner radius progression
- Shapes with 100% radius should be perfect circles/ellipses
- Borders should follow the curved edges correctly

### Slide 4: Combined Test
- All three fixes working together in a single slide
- Demonstrates that fixes don't interfere with each other

## Technical Notes

- Corner radius is calculated as a percentage of half the smaller dimension
- For 100% radius, the canvas API's `ellipse()` method is used for perfect curves
- Clipping paths are used for images to ensure proper corner radius
- Blurb tails are drawn as separate triangular paths after the main bubble
- All opacity and blend mode settings are preserved

## Browser Compatibility

The fixes use standard Canvas 2D API features that are widely supported:
- `ctx.ellipse()` - Supported in all modern browsers
- `ctx.clip()` - Standard clipping functionality
- `ctx.quadraticCurveTo()` - Standard path drawing

## Performance Considerations

- The fixes add minimal overhead to PDF generation
- Clipping paths are only created when corner radius > 0
- Ellipse drawing is only used when radius = 100%
- No additional image processing or complex calculations required
