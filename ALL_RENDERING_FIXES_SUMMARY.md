# PDF Export & Canvas Rendering Fixes - Complete Summary

## Overview
Fixed multiple rendering issues affecting both canvas display and PDF export functionality in the Figma slides application.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Blurb Element Tails Not Rendering in PDF
**Problem**: Speech bubble tails were missing in PDF exports  
**Solution**: Added complete tail drawing logic for all 8 tail positions in PDF export

### 2. ✅ Image Corner Radius Not Working  
**Problem**: Images weren't showing rounded corners in PDF exports  
**Solution**: Implemented clipping paths for images before drawing

### 3. ✅ Images Not Forming Perfect Circles (Canvas & PDF)
**Problem**: Images with 100% border radius appeared as heavily rounded rectangles instead of perfect circles  
**Solution**: 
- Canvas: Switched from Konva's cornerRadius prop to custom clipping with ctx.ellipse()
- PDF: Updated to use ctx.ellipse() for perfect circular/elliptical clipping
- Applies to both actual images and placeholder images

### 4. ✅ Shapes Not Forming Perfect Circles in PDF
**Problem**: Rectangle shapes with 100% border radius weren't perfect circles in PDF  
**Solution**: Use ctx.ellipse() for 100% radius instead of quadratic curves

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`src/utils/pdf-export.ts`** - PDF export logic
2. **`src/components/canvas/ElementRenderer.tsx`** - Canvas rendering logic

### Key Changes

#### For Perfect Circles (100% border radius)
```javascript
// Use ellipse for mathematically perfect circles
ctx.ellipse(
  centerX, centerY,     // Center point
  radiusX, radiusY,     // Radii (equal for circle, different for ellipse)
  0, 0, 2 * Math.PI     // Full circle
)
```

#### For Rounded Corners (< 100% radius)
```javascript
// Use quadratic curves for rounded corners
ctx.quadraticCurveTo(controlX, controlY, endX, endY)
```

## Visual Differences

### Before Fix
- 100% radius → Heavily rounded rectangle (corners not perfectly curved)
- Visual difference between square and almost-square elements
- Inconsistency between canvas and PDF

### After Fix  
- 100% radius → Perfect geometric circle/ellipse
- Square elements → Perfect circles
- Rectangular elements → Perfect ellipses
- Complete parity between canvas and PDF rendering

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite in `src/test/test-pdf-render-fixes.ts`:

### Test Slides
1. **Blurb Elements** - All 8 tail positions
2. **Image Corner Radius** - 0%, 25%, 50%, 100% radius
3. **Shape Corner Radius** - Progressive radius with perfect circles
4. **Combined Test** - All fixes working together

### What to Verify
- **Blurb tails**: Visible triangular shapes in correct positions
- **Images at 100% radius**: Perfect circles (square) or ellipses (rectangular)
- **Shapes at 100% radius**: Geometrically perfect circles/ellipses
- **Lower radius values**: Smooth rounded corners

## Performance Impact
- Minimal overhead - only applies clipping when needed
- Uses native canvas methods (hardware accelerated)
- Clipping paths cached during render cycle

## Browser Compatibility
All methods used are widely supported:
- `ctx.ellipse()` - All modern browsers
- `ctx.clip()` - Standard Canvas 2D API
- `ctx.quadraticCurveTo()` - Basic canvas functionality

## User Impact
1. **Professional Quality**: Perfect circles essential for avatars, logos, icons
2. **Visual Consistency**: Canvas and PDF exports now match exactly
3. **Intuitive Behavior**: 100% radius creates expected perfect circles
4. **Design Flexibility**: All corner radius values work correctly

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test
```typescript
import { testPDFRenderFixes } from '@/test/test-pdf-render-fixes'
await testPDFRenderFixes() // Generates test-render-fixes.pdf
```

### Manual Testing
1. Create an image element
2. Set border radius to 100%
3. Verify it appears as a perfect circle on canvas
4. Export to PDF and verify matching appearance

## Known Limitations
- Individual corner radius (borderRadiusCorners) only supported for regular rounded corners, not elliptical shapes
- Very small elements (<10px) may show aliasing on curves

## Future Enhancements
- Support for individual corner elliptical radii
- Smooth anti-aliasing for very small circular elements
- Border styling on clipped images (currently borders don't follow the clip path)
