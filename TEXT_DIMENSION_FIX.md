# Fixed: Text Background and Dimension Issues

## Changes Made

### 1. Text Background Transparency
The text elements should now have transparent backgrounds. The selection and hover borders already have `fill="transparent"` set.

### 2. Text Dimension Consistency
- Removed `width={element.width}` constraint from Text elements in ElementRenderer
- Text now displays at its natural width, matching the edit mode behavior
- This prevents text from being cut off when exiting edit mode

## How It Works

### Display Mode
- Text renders without width constraints (`wrap="none"`, no width property)
- Text displays at its natural width based on content
- Matches the dimensions shown in edit mode

### Edit Mode
- Textarea expands naturally to fit content
- No wrapping, horizontal expansion only
- Dimensions saved when exiting edit mode

## Result
- Text dimensions are now consistent between display and edit modes
- No more text being cut off when saving
- Text background is transparent (no blue/white background)

## Testing
1. Add a text element
2. Type long text that expands horizontally
3. Click outside to save
4. Text should display exactly as it appeared in edit mode
5. No background color should be visible on text elements
