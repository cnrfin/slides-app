- `"2021 - 150, 2022 - 180, 2023 - 210"`

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Click the Chart Button**: In the sidebar, click the "Chart" button to open the modal
2. **Enter Your Data**: Type or paste your data in a natural format
3. **Choose Chart Type**: Select the visualization that best fits your data
4. **Pick a Color Scheme**: Choose from various color options
5. **Generate**: Click "Generate Chart" to create your visualization
6. **Add to Slide**: Click "Add to Slide" to insert the chart as an image

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Chart.js Integration:
- Uses Chart.js v4.5.0 (already installed in your project)
- All necessary Chart.js components are registered
- Canvas-based rendering for high-quality image export

### Data Validation:
- Validates parsed data before chart generation
- Checks compatibility (e.g., pie charts need positive values)
- Provides clear error messages for invalid formats

### Image Export:
- Charts are rendered to a hidden canvas
- Exported as PNG data URLs
- Automatically sized and centered on the slide
- Maximum width of 400px for optimal slide layout

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Users:
1. **Clear Data Format**: Use consistent separators (`:`, `-`, or `=`)
2. **Include Units**: Add `$`, `K`, `M` for automatic scaling
3. **Descriptive Labels**: Use meaningful names for data points
4. **Choose Appropriate Types**: 
   - Bar/Column for comparisons
   - Line/Area for trends
   - Pie/Doughnut for parts of a whole

### For Developers:
1. **Error Handling**: All errors are caught and displayed to users
2. **Memory Management**: Chart instances are properly destroyed
3. **Performance**: Canvas is reused, charts are generated efficiently
4. **Accessibility**: Proper labels and ARIA attributes

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

The implementation is designed to be extensible. Potential future features:

1. **AI-Powered Parsing**: Integration with OpenAI for complex natural language
2. **Multi-Dataset Support**: Multiple data series in one chart
3. **Custom Styling**: More granular control over appearance
4. **Chart Templates**: Pre-built templates for common use cases
5. **Data Import**: CSV/Excel file upload support
6. **Animations**: Chart animations for presentations
7. **Live Editing**: Edit chart data after creation
