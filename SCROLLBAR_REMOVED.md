# Scrollbar Removed from Text Editor

## âœ… Change Made

Removed the unnecessary scrollbar from the text editing element. The textarea now:

- **No scrollbar** - Changed `overflow: 'auto'` to `overflow: 'hidden'`
- **No height limit** - Removed `maxHeight: '300px'` restriction
- **Unlimited growth** - Textarea expands to show all content

## Before vs After

### Before:
- Scrollbar appeared when text exceeded 300px height
- Could be distracting during editing
- Not needed since we auto-resize

### After:
- Clean editing experience
- Textarea grows smoothly with content
- All text always visible
- No visual distractions

## Result

The text editor now provides a cleaner, more professional editing experience where the textarea simply expands to accommodate all content without showing any scrollbars.

To test:
1. Double-click a text element
2. Type multiple lines of text
3. The editor grows smoothly without any scrollbar appearing
