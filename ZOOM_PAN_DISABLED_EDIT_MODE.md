# Canvas Zoom/Pan Disabled During Text Edit

## Changes Made

### SlideCanvas.tsx
1. **Zoom Disabled**: Added check in `handleWheel` to prevent zoom while editing text
2. **Pan Disabled**: Added check in `handleStageMouseDown` to prevent panning while editing
3. **Keyboard Disabled**: Space key won't trigger pan mode during text edit
4. **Cursor Fixed**: Cursor stays as default (not grab) during text edit
5. **Visual Indicator**: Shows "Text Edit Mode - Zoom/Pan Disabled" banner

## Why This Change?

Zooming or panning while editing text caused issues:
- Text editor position would become misaligned
- Zoom would affect the textarea size unexpectedly
- User might accidentally pan/zoom when trying to select text
- Strange visual behavior with overlapping elements

## Current Behavior

### During Text Edit Mode:
- ❌ Mouse scroll does NOT zoom
- ❌ Space + drag does NOT pan
- ❌ Canvas interactions disabled
- ✅ Text editing works normally
- ✅ Click outside to save still works

### Normal Mode:
- ✅ Mouse scroll zooms
- ✅ Space + drag pans
- ✅ All canvas interactions work

## Visual Feedback

- **Normal Mode**: Shows zoom percentage (bottom right)
- **Pan Mode**: Shows "Pan Mode (Hold Space + Drag)" (top center)
- **Edit Mode**: Shows "Text Edit Mode - Zoom/Pan Disabled" (top center, amber)

## Testing

1. Add text element
2. Double-click to edit
3. Try to zoom (scroll) - should not work
4. Try to pan (space+drag) - should not work
5. Edit text normally
6. Click outside to save
7. Zoom/pan should work again

This prevents the strange behavior and ensures a stable editing experience!
