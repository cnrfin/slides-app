# Export Options Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added a dropdown menu for the Export button that allows users to choose between exporting all slides or just the current slide.

## Changes Made

### 1. **New Component: ExportDropdown**
Created `src/components/ui/ExportDropdown.tsx`
- Dropdown menu that appears below the Export button
- Two options with icons and descriptions:
  - **Export all slides** - Downloads the entire presentation as PDF
  - **Export current slide** - Downloads only the visible slide as PDF
- Features:
  - Click outside to close
  - Escape key to close
  - Smooth fade-in animation
  - Hover effects on options
  - Visual feedback with icons

### 2. **Updated RightSidebar Component**
Modified `src/components/sidebar/RightSidebar.tsx`
- Replaced simple Export button with ExportDropdown component
- Updated props interface:
  - Changed `onExportPDF` to `onExportAllPDF` and `onExportCurrentPDF`
  - Now handles two separate export actions

### 3. **Updated App Component**
Modified `src/App.tsx`
- Implemented two separate export handlers:
  
  **Export All Slides:**
  - Exports all slides in the presentation
  - Uses presentation's slide order for correct sequencing
  - Filename: `{presentation_name}.pdf`
  - Toast notification: "All slides exported successfully!"
  
  **Export Current Slide:**
  - Exports only the currently visible slide
  - Filename includes slide number: `{presentation_name}_slide_{number}.pdf`
  - Toast notification: "Slide {number} exported successfully!"
  - Shows error if no slide is selected

### 4. **UI/UX Features**

**Visual Design:**
- Clean white dropdown with shadow
- Icons for each option (FileDown for all, FileImage for current)
- Hover effects with color transitions
- Chevron icon rotates when dropdown is open
- Separator line between options

**Interaction:**
- Click export button to toggle dropdown
- Click an option to execute and close dropdown
- Click outside or press Escape to close without action
- Button shows pressed state with scale animation

## Usage

Users can now:
1. Click the Export button to see options
2. Choose "Export all slides" to download the complete presentation
3. Choose "Export current slide" to download only what's visible on canvas
4. Each option generates appropriately named PDF files

## File Naming Convention

- **All slides**: `presentation_name.pdf`
- **Current slide**: `presentation_name_slide_1.pdf` (where 1 is the slide number)
- Special characters in names are replaced with underscores

## Technical Notes

- The export functionality leverages the existing `exportSlidesToPDF` function
- Slide order is maintained using the presentation's `slides` array
- Progress tracking and toast notifications provide user feedback
- Error handling ensures graceful failure with user-friendly messages

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/ui/ExportDropdown.tsx` - New dropdown component
2. `src/components/sidebar/RightSidebar.tsx` - Updated to use dropdown
3. `src/App.tsx` - Added separate handlers for each export option
4. `src/components/ui/index.ts` - Added ExportDropdown export

## Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Users can quickly export just the slide they're working on
- **Efficiency**: No need to export entire presentation when only one slide is needed
- **Clarity**: Clear labels and descriptions help users understand their options
- **Consistency**: Maintains the existing UI style and interaction patterns
