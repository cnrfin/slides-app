# üéâ Canvas Fixed!

## Summary of Fixes

I've successfully fixed all the canvas issues you reported. Here's what was done:

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

1. **Dragging Problems**
   - Elements were becoming undraggable due to state conflicts
   - Fixed by separating drag logic and improving event handling
   - Added drag boundaries to keep elements on canvas
   - Elements now drag smoothly without interruption

2. **Canvas Styling**
   - Changed dimensions from 1920x1080 to **800x600** (as per guide)
   - Added white background with subtle shadow
   - Light gray border for clear boundaries
   - Professional elevation effect

3. **Navigation**
   - **Space + Drag** for smooth panning
   - **Mouse wheel** for zooming (33% - 200%)
   - Visual indicators for current mode
   - Fixed panning calculation issues

4. **Performance**
   - Created separate `ElementRenderer` component
   - Memoized components to reduce re-renders
   - Optimized drag performance
   - Better state management

5. **User Experience**
   - Cursor changes on hover (move cursor for draggable elements)
   - Visual feedback for selected elements
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Delete, Ctrl+A, Escape)
   - Zoom percentage indicator

### üöÄ Quick Test

Run the app:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Or use the test script:
```bash
test-app.bat
```

### üéØ Try These Actions

1. **Add elements** - Click "Add Text" or "Add Rectangle"
2. **Drag elements** - Should be smooth and continuous
3. **Pan canvas** - Hold Space + drag
4. **Zoom** - Use mouse wheel
5. **Select multiple** - Ctrl + click elements
6. **Delete** - Select element(s) and press Delete

### üìÅ Modified Files
