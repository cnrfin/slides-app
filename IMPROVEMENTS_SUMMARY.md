# Figma Slides App - User Experience Improvements

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. ✅ Text Auto-Sizing Based on Content
- Text elements now automatically size themselves based on their content
- When adding new text, the element is created with dimensions that fit the default text "Click to edit text"
- Removed fixed dimensions and scrollbars from text elements
- Updated `text.utils.ts` with new measurement functions for natural text dimensions

### 2. ✅ Multi-line Support with Dynamic Expansion
- Press Enter to create new lines - the element expands vertically
- The textarea automatically resizes both horizontally and vertically as you type
- Maximum width constraint prevents text from becoming too wide
- After editing, the text element updates to the natural dimensions of the content

### 3. ✅ Fixed Dragging Behavior
- Removed snapback behavior and constraints
- Elements can now be dragged anywhere on the canvas, even outside the slide boundaries
- Removed `dragBoundFunc` constraints from ElementRenderer
- Removed `DRAG_LIMITS` from canvas constants

### 4. ✅ Opacity Effect for Elements Outside Slide
- Elements partially or completely outside the slide area now have reduced opacity (0.3)
- Implemented smart clipping to show:
  - Full opacity for parts inside the slide
  - Reduced opacity for parts outside the slide
- Complete rewrite of ElementRenderer to handle three cases:
  - Fully inside: normal rendering
  - Partially outside: dual rendering with clipping
  - Completely outside: reduced opacity

### 5. ✅ Hover Effect
- Added light gray border (#9ca3af) on hover to indicate elements can be selected
- Hover state is managed in SlideCanvas and passed to ElementRenderer
- Cursor changes to 'move' on hover (or 'not-allowed' if locked)

### 6. ✅ Selection Border
- Selected elements show a blue border (#3b82f6) with 2px width
- Selection border maintains full opacity even when the element is outside the slide area
- Border is rendered as a separate layer to ensure visibility

### 7. ✅ No Tooltips
- No tooltips were added to canvas elements as requested

## How to Use

### Text Editing
1. **Add text**: Click "Add Text" button - creates auto-sized text element
2. **Edit text**: Double-click any text element to start editing
3. **Multi-line**: Press Enter to create new lines (element expands automatically)
4. **Save changes**: Click anywhere outside to save
5. **Cancel**: Press Escape to cancel without saving

### Element Manipulation
1. **Select**: Click on any element
2. **Multi-select**: Hold Ctrl/Cmd and click multiple elements

### Visual Feedback
- **Hover**: Light gray border shows element is interactive
- **Selected**: Blue border indicates selection
- **Outside slide**: Elements have reduced opacity when outside slide boundaries
- **Editing**: Blue border around text editor during editing

## Technical Details

### Key Components Updated
1. **text.utils.ts**: New measurement functions for dynamic text sizing
2. **InlineTextEditor.tsx**: Auto-resizing textarea with proper multi-line support
3. **ElementRenderer.tsx**: Complete rewrite with clipping and opacity logic
4. **SlideCanvas.tsx**: Added hover state management and improved text editing
5. **App.tsx**: Updated to use dynamic text measurements

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient clipping using Konva's `clipFunc`
- Memoized element rendering to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized hover state updates
- Minimal DOM manipulation during text editing
