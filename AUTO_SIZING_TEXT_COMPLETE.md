# Auto-Sizing Text Implementation Complete

## Summary

We've successfully implemented auto-sizing text elements in the Figma Slides-style application with the following features:

### âœ… Completed Features

1. **Auto-sizing Text Elements**
   - Text elements now automatically resize to fit their content
   - No fixed width constraints - dimensions adjust based on text content
   - Minimum dimensions enforced (50px width, 30px height)

2. **Improved Inline Text Editing**
   - Enter key creates new lines instead of saving (proper multi-line support)
   - Click outside to save and exit editing mode
   - Escape key to cancel editing
   - No scrollbars - textarea auto-resizes to content

3. **No Transform Handles for Text**
   - Text elements can be moved but not resized or rotated
   - Transformer configured with `resizeEnabled={false}` and `rotateEnabled={false}`
   - Clean editing experience focused on content

4. **Dynamic Dimension Updates**
   - Text dimensions update automatically when content changes
   - Uses Konva's native text measurement for accurate sizing
   - Supports proper line breaks and multi-line text

## Key Implementation Details

### Text Utilities (`text.utils.ts`)
- Added `measureAutoText()` function for measuring text without width constraints
- Considers line breaks and calculates dimensions based on the widest line
- Includes padding in dimension calculations

### Inline Text Editor (`InlineTextEditor.tsx`)
- Auto-resizes both width and height based on content
- Passes new dimensions back to parent on save
- Handles click-outside detection for saving
- No overflow or scrollbars

### Canvas Updates (`SlideCanvas.tsx`)
- Updated text edit handler to accept dimensions
- Passes scale prop to text editor for proper scaling
- Transformer disabled for resize/rotate operations

### App Updates (`App.tsx`)
- Text elements created with auto-measured dimensions
- Uses `measureAutoText()` to calculate initial size
- Centers text elements properly on the canvas

## Usage

1. **Adding Text**: Click "Add Text" button - creates auto-sized text element
2. **Editing Text**: Double-click text element to enter edit mode
3. **Multi-line Text**: Press Enter to create new lines while editing
4. **Save Changes**: Click outside the text editor
5. **Cancel Editing**: Press Escape key

## Next Steps

The text editing system is now complete with auto-sizing behavior matching tools like Figma. Text elements adapt to their content naturally without manual resizing.
