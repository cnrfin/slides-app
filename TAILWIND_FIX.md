# ðŸš¨ URGENT FIX FOR TAILWIND CSS ERROR

## The Problem
Tailwind CSS v4 has breaking changes and requires a completely different setup. The `bg-gray-50` and other utility classes are not being recognized.

## Immediate Solution

### Option 1: Run the Batch Script (Recommended)
```cmd
switch-to-tailwind-v3-now.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Commands
Run these commands in your terminal:
```bash
# Remove v4
pnpm remove tailwindcss @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/typography @tailwindcss/postcss

# Install v3
pnpm add -D tailwindcss@^3.4.0 autoprefixer postcss
pnpm add -D @tailwindcss/forms@^0.5.7 @tailwindcss/typography@^0.5.10

# Start dev server
pnpm dev
```

### Option 3: PowerShell
```powershell
.\switch-to-tailwind-v3-now.ps1
```

## Alternative: Test Without Tailwind
If you want to test if the app works without Tailwind:

1. Edit `src/main.tsx`
2. Change:
   ```tsx
   import './styles/globals.css'
   ```
   To:
   ```tsx
   import './styles/test.css'
   ```
3. Run `pnpm dev`

## Why This Is Happening
- Tailwind CSS v4 (released recently) has a completely new architecture
- It uses a new compiler written in Rust
- The PostCSS plugin has been moved to `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- Many utility classes and configurations have changed

## After Fixing
Once you run the script and switch to v3, your app will work with:
- All standard Tailwind utility classes (`bg-gray-50`, etc.)
- Tailwind plugins (forms, typography)
- Your existing configuration

The app will start successfully and you'll see your Figma-style slide editor!
