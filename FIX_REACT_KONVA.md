# 🚨 FIX GUIDE: React-Konva Compatibility Error

## The Error
```
Uncaught Error: react-konva version 19 is only compatible with React 19.
```

## Why This Happened
- react-konva v19 requires React 19 (which is not stable yet)
- We're using React 18 (stable version)
- react-konva wasn't properly added to package.json

## ✅ Quick Solution

### Option 1: One Command Fix
```cmd
quick-fix.bat
```
This will install react-konva v18 and start the dev server.

### Option 2: Fix Everything at Once
```cmd
fix-all-issues.bat
```
This fixes both react-konva AND Tailwind CSS issues.

### Option 3: Manual Fix
```bash
pnpm add react-konva@^18.2.10
pnpm dev
```

## 📋 Current Status

Looking at your `package.json`:
- ✅ React 18.3.1 (correct)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS 3.4.0 (already correct!)
- ❌ react-konva missing (needs v18)

## 🎯 After Fixing

Your app will work with:
- Canvas rendering with Konva.js
- Drag and drop elements
- Multi-selection with transformer
- All Tailwind styles
- Slide management

## 🔍 Verify Everything Works
