# Revert to Original Inline Text Editing - Summary

## Successfully Reverted to Original Implementation

### Inline Text Editing (Back to Original)
- ✅ Simple textarea with auto-resize vertically only
- ✅ Fixed width text boxes (200px) with word wrapping
- ✅ Enter without Shift saves the text
- ✅ Shift + Enter creates new lines
- ✅ Escape cancels editing
- ✅ No scale parameter or dynamic width adjustments
- ✅ Height adjusts based on content after editing
- ✅ Center-aligned text by default
- ✅ No scrollbars (overflow: hidden)

### No Transformation Tools
- ✅ Removed resize handles
- ✅ Removed rotation controls
- ✅ Only selection border with drag capability
- ✅ Dashed border for selected elements

### Preserved Improvements
- ✅ Free dragging anywhere on canvas (no constraints)
- ✅ Opacity effect for elements outside slide (30% opacity)
- ✅ Clipping for partially outside elements
- ✅ Hover effects with gray border
- ✅ Selection borders maintain full opacity

## Current Behavior

1. **Text Editing**: Double-click to edit, Enter saves, Shift+Enter for new lines
2. **Element Movement**: Drag elements anywhere without constraints
3. **Visual Feedback**: Hover shows gray border, selection shows blue dashed border
4. **Opacity**: Elements outside slide show at reduced opacity

The application now uses the original inline text editing method while keeping all the visual improvements for dragging and opacity effects.
