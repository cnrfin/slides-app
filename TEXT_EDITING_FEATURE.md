# Text Editing Feature - Complete!

## ✨ What's New

I've added **double-click text editing** to the canvas, similar to how Figma and other design tools work.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Double-click to Edit**
   - Double-click any text element to enter edit mode
   - A text editor appears in place with the same styling

2. **Keyboard Controls**
   - **Enter** - Save changes (without Shift)
   - **Shift + Enter** - Add new line
   - **Escape** - Cancel editing
   - Click outside to save

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Blue border around text being edited
   - Text element hides while editing
   - Auto-resizing textarea
   - Shadow effect for better visibility

4. **Seamless Integration**
   - Maintains text position during edit
   - Scales with zoom level
   - Preserves all text styling (font, size, color, alignment)

## 🚀 How to Test

Run the app:
```bash
test-text-editing.bat
```

Or manually:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Test Steps:
1. Click "Add Text" to create a text element
2. **Double-click** the text to edit it
3. Type your new text
4. Press **Enter** to save or **Escape** to cancel

## 🏗️ Architecture

### New Components:
- **`InlineTextEditor.tsx`** - Overlay text editor component
- Positioned absolutely over the canvas
- Auto-resizing textarea
- Handles keyboard events

### Modified Components:
- **`SlideCanvas.tsx`** - Added text editing state and handlers
- **`ElementRenderer.tsx`** - Added double-click support for text
- **`App.tsx`** - Updated keyboard shortcuts display

### How It Works:
1. User double-clicks a text element
2. Canvas calculates the absolute position of the text
3. InlineTextEditor appears at that position
4. Text element becomes invisible while editing
5. On save, the text content is updated in the store
6. Editor disappears and text element reappears

## 📝 Code Structure

```
src/components/canvas/
├── SlideCanvas.tsx      # Manages editing state
├── ElementRenderer.tsx  # Handles double-click
└── InlineTextEditor.tsx # Text editing overlay
```

## 🎯 Next Possible Features

- Rich text editing (bold, italic, etc.)
- Font picker in properties panel
- Text alignment buttons
- Spell check
- Multi-line text with better wrapping
- Copy/paste text formatting

The text editing feature is now fully functional and provides a smooth, professional editing experience!
