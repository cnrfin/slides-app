# Slide Deletion Database Sync Fix

## Problem
When slides were deleted from a lesson in the UI, they were removed from the local state but not from the Supabase database. This caused orphaned slide records to accumulate in the database.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Cleanup During Save (database.ts)
Updated the `saveLesson` function to:
- Fetch all existing slides for the lesson before saving
- Track which slides are currently active in the presentation
- Delete any slides that exist in the database but are no longer in the presentation's slide order
- This ensures database consistency with the local state

### 2. Auto-Save Trigger on Delete (slideStore.ts)
Updated the `deleteSlide` function to:
- Update the order of remaining slides after deletion
- Trigger auto-save to persist the deletion to the database immediately
- This ensures deletions are saved without requiring manual save

### 3. Database Schema Enhancement (Optional)
Created a migration file to add CASCADE DELETE constraints:
- When a lesson is deleted, all its slides are automatically deleted
- When a slide is deleted, all its elements are automatically deleted
- This prevents orphaned records at the database level

## How to Apply the Changes

### Step 1: Code Changes (Already Applied)
The code changes have been applied to:
- `src/lib/database.ts` - Added orphaned slide cleanup logic
- `src/stores/slideStore.ts` - Added auto-save trigger on delete

### Step 2: Database Migration (Recommended)
Run the migration in `docs/database-cascade-delete-migration.sql` on your Supabase database:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `database-cascade-delete-migration.sql`
4. Execute the query

This will add CASCADE DELETE constraints to ensure data integrity.

## Testing

To verify the fix works correctly:

1. Create a lesson with multiple slides
2. Save the lesson to the database
3. Delete one or more slides
4. Check the Supabase dashboard to confirm:
   - The deleted slides are removed from the `slides` table
   - The `slide_order` in the `lessons` table is updated correctly
   - No orphaned slide_elements remain

## Benefits

- **Data Consistency**: Database stays in sync with UI state
- **Storage Efficiency**: No accumulation of orphaned records
- **Performance**: Cleaner database with only active data
- **Reliability**: CASCADE DELETE ensures referential integrity

## Notes

- The fix handles both manual slide deletion and bulk operations
- Auto-save is triggered after deletion to persist changes immediately
- The CASCADE DELETE migration is optional but recommended for data integrity
- Existing orphaned slides will be cleaned up on the next save operation
